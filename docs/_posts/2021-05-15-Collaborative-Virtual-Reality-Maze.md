In a time when itâ€™s difficult to get together with friends, collaborative
games offer a safe way to interact with others remotely. Although multiplayer
video games have been around for nearly as long as video games themselves,
new technologies make room for improving immersion and overall
experience. Most recently, virtual reality has offered players the
opportunity to enter the world of a game like never before, opening new
options for developers to tell stories and entertain their audience.
Asymmetrical multiplayer VR games, those that involve only a portion of the
players in VR, show promise as a method for allowing people to come together
remotely without feeling the distance. Adding custom, microcontroller based
peripherals furthers the immersive aspects of the experience, creating the
opportunity for exciting collaboration over long distances.

Our game is developed for a team of two or more players, and challenges the
team to work together in order to escape from a randomly generated maze. One
player wears a VR headset and is charged with exploring the maze. The
remaining players use a custom, microcontroller based peripheral to view a
map of the maze's layout. However, the player exploring the maze has no
knowledge of its layout and the players viewing the maze have no knowledge of
the explorer's position or heading. By exploring the maze and communicating
the explorer's findings, the team can gather enough information to determine
the explorer's location and guide them to the exit.
