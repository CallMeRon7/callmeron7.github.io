With the rise of the internet of things, more and more aspects of life being
integrated with technology in novel ways. Furthermore, the rise of digital
agriculture is creating ways to improve crop yield and gather meaningful
information. In this project, we set out to create a small footprint,
vertically scalable gardening system capable of caring for common garden
plants.

Our system uses hydroponics, avoiding the need for fertilizer or soil.
Instead, the plants are grown in a moisture wicking media that is supplied
with nutrient rich solution. A RaspberryPi measures the pH and
parts-per-million (PPM) of the nutrient solution. The pH measurements give an
indication of how well-suited the solution is to the type of plants being
grown, and the PPM measurement indicates the concentration of nutrients in
the solution. Both measures are important for ensuring healthy crops. The
RaspberryPi is also in control of delivering the nutrient solution and
capturing images of the plants to determine their heights. All data is
presented to the user through a web UI.
